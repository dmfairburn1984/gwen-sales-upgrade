        "question": "How can I prolong the life of my furniture?",
        "answer": "Where possible, we recommend storing your furniture indoors during winter (such as inside a shed or outbuilding) to protect it from any harsh weather. If this is not possible, we advise using a protective furniture cover and storing any cushions inside. Regular cleaning and proper care for specific materials like teak, polyrattan, or cushions will also extend durability."

    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How long does polyrattan furniture last?",
        "answer": "Polyrattan garden furniture can last as much as 20 years outdoors, even if left out all winter, with proper maintenance and protection from harsh weather."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I leave my polyrattan furniture outside during winter?",
        "answer": "While our polyrattan furniture sets can be kept outside all year, we would still advise you to store it indoors where possible, or cover it with a breathable cover in order to maintain the condition of your furniture for as long as possible. If covering your furniture, it is also a good idea to move it and clean the area underneath every few months in order to prevent any buildup of dirt."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I clean polyrattan garden furniture?",
        "answer": "Simply fill a bucket of lukewarm, soapy water and use a soft sponge or cloth to gently clean your furniture, before washing off any soap with cold water. Remove cushions before cleaning and do not use a pressure washer as this can damage the material. We do not recommend using any abrasive, chemical cleaning products on your furniture unless recommended by a professional."

    "items": [
      {
        "question": "Can I leave my cushions outside?",
        "answer": "Although using a furniture cover or outdoor storage box can provide a level of protection, we always recommend removing cushions and storing them indoors during the winter or any harsh weather spells in order to maintain their condition as well as possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I machine wash my cushions?",
        "answer": "We advise handwashing olefin cushions by rinsing them in a bowl of warm, soapy water and then a bowl of plain water. Machine washing is at the customer's discretion and would need to be done on a very gentle cycle to avoid the risk of shrinkage or distortion. MINT cannot accept responsibility for damage caused by machine washing cushions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I spill something on my cushions?",
        "answer": "Spot clean any spillages by gently blotting the area with a clean cloth or sponge using lukewarm, soapy water. Avoid rubbing vigorously as this may spread the stain or damage the fabric. For stubborn stains, use a mild detergent suitable for outdoor fabrics, and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterward. Always test any cleaning solution on a small, inconspicuous area first."

      },
      {
        "question": "Could my order be delayed?",
        "answer": "Any MINT Essentials products that are in stock for 5-10 day delivery are highly unlikely to be delayed, due to already being in the UK. OUR MINT DesignDrops have a despatch date listed on each individual product page. Delays typically do not occur at this point, as once the furniture is shipped, it is on its way to the UK and your home. In the unlikely event any delays do occur, we will notify you by email or phone."

        "question": "How do I care for teak furniture?",
        "answer": "Teak is naturally durable but benefits from annual sealing with teak oil. Clean with mild soap and water. It will naturally silver over time if left untreated, which is normal and doesn't affect quality."

        "question": "What about aluminium furniture maintenance?",
