    "cleaning": [
      "1. Clean with mild soap and water.",
      "2. Dry thoroughly to prevent water spots."
    ],
    "protection": "Powder-coated finish provides excellent weather resistance; no extra sealant needed.",

    "maintenance": [
      "1. Brush fabric regularly to remove dirt.",
      "2. Allow cushions to dry fully after rain."
